# FIFA World Cup Big Data Project

Welcome to the FIFA World Cup Dashboard! This project analyzes historical and live match data to uncover trends and insights from the world's most prestigious football tournament.

**Project Goals:**
- Combine historical and live data for a comprehensive view of World Cup matches
- Provide interactive visualizations and KPIs for fans and analysts
- Enable exploration of trends across different editions

**Data Sources:**
- Historical CSV data (static)
- Live match data from RapidAPI (dynamic)

**Transformations:**
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Merging and deduplication
- Conversion to Parquet format for efficient analytics

**What You Can Learn:**
- Key match statistics and trends by edition
- Team performance, scoring patterns, and more
- Insights into home vs away wins, top scorers, and attendance

    #### üîÅ Daily Tasks
    
    **Task 1: Fetch Live Match Data**
    - Use Airflow to hit a football match API daily
    - Retrieve new match data
    - Handle API rate limits and errors
    - Store raw data in staging area
    
    **Task 2: Append & Store as Parquet**
    - Clean and transform new data
    - Merge with historical dataset
    - Update Parquet files
    - Maintain data versioning
    
    **Task 3: Invalidate Cache / Refresh Dashboard**
    - Clear Streamlit cache after updates
    - Send Slack/email notifications
    - Update last-modified timestamp
    - Trigger dashboard refresh
    
    **Task 4: Data Validation**
    - Check for missing entries
    - Identify duplicates
    - Validate data consistency
    - Flag anomalies for review
    
    #### üëÅÔ∏è Monitoring
    
    **Airflow UI Features**
    - DAG execution status
    - Task success/failure tracking
    - Detailed execution logs
    - Performance metrics
    
    **Alerting System**
    - Email notifications for failures
    - Slack integration for team updates
    - Custom alert thresholds
    - Error reporting
